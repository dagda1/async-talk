==============
### Setup

1. Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org or your favorite package manager.

2. Install grunt and bower. `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`

3. Run `npm install && bower install` inside the project root to install the JS dependencies.

4. Harmony generators are not turned on by default but the procedure to enable them is easy: open the chrome://flags page then check the "Enable Experimental JavaScript" option and restart Canary.
